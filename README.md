Code for the Modelling Techniques 1 assignment (Year 2 Mechanical Engineering) to simulate an anti-drone sentry turret.

The aim of this assignment was to simulate the flight path of a drone-capturing projectile before and after capturing the drone and deploying a parachute. This code implements both Euler and Runge-Kutta-4 differential equation solvers, along with a GUI that allows the starting conditions and solver parameters to be adjusted, before computing and visualising the results.

_The MATLAB version used was R2016b_
